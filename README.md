# Small Python Projects 
Desided to finally start working on different (mini)projects. Was following Tech with Tim video.

So here it is. Will update this file as often as I can and then will start working on some other stuff :)

In the 'password_manager' file, you have to 'uncomment' the 'load_key' function in order to get the key for the 1st time, then you must comment it again to avoid mistakes.
